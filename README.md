**Secteur V** is the community and competitive platform dedicated to **Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road** players. It allows players to manage their profile, track their progress via a dynamic ELO ranking, and archive their match history. Designed to centralize competition, this project offers a seamless experience connected directly to Discord.

## Summary

The project addresses the need to structure the game's competitive scene. Rather than managing rankings manually and community by community, **Secteur V** automates score tracking, offers shareable public profiles, and secures player identity via OAuth2 authentication (Discord).

## Features

* **Discord Authentication:** Secure login via OAuth2, automatically retrieving the avatar and username.
* **ELO Ranking (Ladder):** Dynamic rank system calculated based on performance.
* **Player Profiles (Files):** Public page displaying stats, bio, current rank, and match history.
* **Account Management:** Interface to edit bio, contact information, or delete data (GDPR).
